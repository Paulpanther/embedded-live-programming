# Embedded Live Programming
Implementation of my Master Thesis about a live programming environment for embedded programming.
Enables user to write examples and replacements for classes to run them in isolation from other components.
Code is always executed live (on save) and interesting parts of code are annotated with probes that show the current value of that expression.

## Setup
